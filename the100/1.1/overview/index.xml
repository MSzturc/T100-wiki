Matt himself has created a great assembly guide on YouTube but those videos don&amp;rsquo;t go in to detail about how to actually print the parts. I struggled with knowing how many of each part to print and which parts I actually needed.</description></item><item><title>Why print THE 100?</title><link>https://theforgetful.dev/the100/1.1/overview/why-print-the-100/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2023 14:41:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://theforgetful.dev/the100/1.1/overview/why-print-the-100/</guid><description>Why print THE 100? # For me, 3d printing is purely a hobby. 50% of the fun for me is tweaking it. I could go out right now and buy a Bambu and get some incredible prints, but the lack of playing and tweaking isn&amp;rsquo;t what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for. THE 100 is kind of the opposite of that: you have to build it yourself and you are solely responsible for making it work.</description></item><item><title>Before you print</title><link>https://theforgetful.dev/the100/1.1/overview/before-you-print/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2023 14:41:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://theforgetful.dev/the100/1.1/overview/before-you-print/</guid><description>Before you start printing # The official BOM is available here, and I have a detailed list here. I suggest reviewing them and confirming you can get everything you need prior to starting to print the parts.
STL Links # The files for v1.1 have only been made available in beta to Matt&amp;rsquo;s Patreon supporters so I can&amp;rsquo;t provide links to the downloads. I will get links added once it is made available to the public.</description></item><item><title>Bill of Materials</title><link>https://theforgetful.dev/the100/1.1/overview/bill-of-materials/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2023 14:41:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://theforgetful.dev/the100/1.1/overview/bill-of-materials/</guid><description>Bill of Materials # The printhead, frame, gantry, and more are all 3d printed parts. That&amp;rsquo;s what makes this printer so awesome. But for obvious reasons there are still a number of items that need to be purchased.
The official BOM is available here.
Some of the more expensive parts or more commonly asked about parts are (in no particular order):
Ender 2 Pro heated bed (yes, Ender 2.
