Matt himself has created a great assembly guide on YouTube but those videos don&amp;rsquo;t go in to detail about how to actually print the parts. I struggled with knowing how many of each part to print and which parts I actually needed.</description></item><item><title>Why print THE 100?</title><link>https://mszturc.github.io/T100-wiki/t100/1.0/overview/why-print-the-100/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2023 14:41:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://mszturc.github.io/T100-wiki/t100/1.0/overview/why-print-the-100/</guid><description>Why print THE 100? # For me, 3d printing is purely a hobby. 50% of the fun for me is tweaking it.

That&amp;rsquo;s what makes this printer so awesome. But for obvious reasons there are still a number of items that need to be purchased.
The official BOM is available here. I suggest reviewing it and confirming you can get everything you need prior to starting to print the parts.
Some of the more expensive parts or more commonly asked about parts are (in no particular order):</description></item></channel></rss>
