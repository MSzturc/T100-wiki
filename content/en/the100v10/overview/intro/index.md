# THE 100 3d Printer

<img src="images/top_banner.png" width=800>

## Welcome!
If you found this page then you probably already know what THE 100 project is, but just in case you don't: it's a 3d printable 3d printer designed by <a href="https://github.com/MSzturc">Matt</a>. 

Matt himself has created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC4BB4BhjOo&list=PLM01o_dfwbDcKYB-9yV0vLs5k0CrHUv0W&pp=iAQB">great assembly guide on YouTube</a> but those videos don't go in to detail about how to actually print the parts. I struggled with knowing how many of each part to print and which parts I actually needed. As I've spent more time in THE 100 discord, I've seen these same questions come up often. 

Matt is working hard on v1.1 which has a number of changed parts (see <a href="/the100/overview/before-you-print/#warning">this warning</a> before you start printing), and he already said v2 is going to be a pretty massive design change, so the confusion around what to print for different versions is only going to make it harder for people to know where to start.

That inspired me to create this guide. It helps me remember it for future prints, and it will hopefully be helpful for others as well.

{{< alert icon="â›”" context="warning" text="This guide for THE 100 v1.0 is now considered complete aside from correcting any issues that are found. I am switching focus to working on v1.1 which will be a more thorough guide." />}}

## What is this guide for?
This guide is meant to answer questions about THE 100 like:

  * How many of each part do I need?
  * How many screws do I need of each size? How many heat inserts? And how many nuts?
  * How do the GitHub stls compare with the Printables stls?
  * How much filament does each piece need?
  * Mistakes to avoid
  * And a lot more

Now you may be wondering: <a href="/the100/1.0/overview/why-print-the100/">why should I even print one of these</a>?
