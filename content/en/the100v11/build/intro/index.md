# Start your build
This guide is meant to be used as a supplement to Matt's excellent build videos on YouTube. 

He does a great job walking you through what is needed and I recommend watching each video a couple times before getting started. This guide -- at least in its current form -- is meant to provide additional clarification or details on steps in the videos. 

I will continue to update the build guide as additional questions come up from those that are building The 100. 

Ready to go? Let's build the toolhead!
