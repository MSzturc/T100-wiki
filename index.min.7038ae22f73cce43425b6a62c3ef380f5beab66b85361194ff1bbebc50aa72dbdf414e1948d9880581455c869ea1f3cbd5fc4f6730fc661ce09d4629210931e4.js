Matt himself has created a great assembly guide on YouTube but those videos don&rsquo;t go in to detail about how to actually print the parts. I struggled with knowing how many of each part to print and which parts I actually needed. As I&rsquo;ve spent more time in THE 100 discord, I&rsquo;ve seen these same questions come up often.
Matt is working hard on v1.1 which has a number of changed parts (see this warning before you start printing), and he already said v2 is going to be a pretty massive design change, so the confusion around what to print for different versions is only going to make it harder for people to know where to start.
That inspired me to create this guide. It helps me remember it for future prints, and it will hopefully be helpful for others as well.
⛔ This guide for THE 100 v1.0 is now considered complete aside from correcting any issues that are found. I am switching focus to working on v1.1 which will be a more thorough guide. What is this guide for? # This guide is meant to answer questions about THE 100 like:

That&rsquo;s what makes this printer so awesome. But for obvious reasons there are still a number of items that need to be purchased.
The official BOM is available here. I suggest reviewing it and confirming you can get everything you need prior to starting to print the parts.
Some of the more expensive parts or more commonly asked about parts are (in no particular order):
Ender 2 Pro heated bed (yes, Ender 2. Not 3) SKR Pico mainboard Banana Pi M2 Zero ~3KG of filament I was able to purchase everything I needed off AliExpress. In the future I will post links to the companies I used.
STL Links # Each part contains a link to the STL on GitHub and the STL on Printables. In nearly every case the filenames are different, and in a few cases there are parts differences between the two. I have included the filenames in the links to help you understand how the parts align between the two sources. Make sure to read the part notes if you&rsquo;re confused about a particular part.
Warning # The current revision of this guide is based on THE 100 v1.0. The biggest issue with that is I never actually printed v1.0. I support Matt on Patreon and through that I had access to newer parts and I printed those instead. The printer I made is much closer to v1.1 than it is v1. That means my counts for screws and heat inserts will be slightly off because I don&rsquo;t have an actual machine to compare them to. It also means I don&rsquo;t have any tips/tricks that are specific to v1.0 because I didn&rsquo;t print it.
I will be updating this guide to reference v1.1 parts but at the moment they&rsquo;re a Patreon exclusive so I won&rsquo;t be distributing them.
Print settings # I printed all parts with a 0.6 nozzle using the recomended print settings which are:
0.25 Layer height 0.5 Line width 3 Top layers 3 Bottom layers 3 Walls Grid Infill Pattern 25% Infill Use 30% infill for the print bed to move the center of gravity to where it&rsquo;s needed Additional info and support # This project wouldn&rsquo;t exist without Matt so I wanted to provide a list of links back to him and his resources:

Warning # Version 1.1 is a major work-in-progress. There are going to be broken images, broken links, and missing info while I work on it. But I&rsquo;m publishing my progress as I go so it can still be of some use. The current revision of this guide is based on THE 100 v1.1-beta1. That means my counts for screws and heat inserts may be slightly off once v1.1-final is released. It should be very close though.
I will be updating this guide to reference v1.1-final once it is released.
Print details # This guide includes details such as how much filament is used to print a part. Note that these numbers are always for a quantity of 1. If a particular part requires 4 then you need to multiply the filament length/weight by 4. The same is true for assembly hardware counts.
ℹ️ Weights are for PLA based on a density of 1.24 g/cm3.
Print time # Using a standard stock Ender 3 style printer at typical speeds and based on the print settings below, you should expect the whole printer to take about 173 hours to print. It can absolutely be much less than that if you&rsquo;re using a faster or upgraded printer, but the typical maker should expect around that number.
ℹ️ The estimated print times displayed in the print guide are based on a stock Ender 3 using default settings.
Print settings # The recommended print settings are:
0.4 or 0.6 nozzle (0.6 will be slightly faster, but you can use either) 0.25 Layer height 0.5 Line width 3 Top layers 3 Bottom layers 3 Walls Grid Infill Pattern 25% Infill Use 30% infill for the print bed to move the center of gravity to where it&rsquo;s needed Assembly hardware # Each section includes details on the parts you need to purchase for assembly. I decided the easiest way to assign where to list a screw or a heat insert is:
Heat inserts are assigned to the object where they actually get put in to Screws are assigned to the object where you see the screw head As mentioned above under print details, the quantity of heat inserts and screws at a per-part level is based on a quantity of 1. If you need 4 of a particular part, multiply the heat insert/screw count by 4.

Fasteners / Hardware # Screw lengths can often be interchanged with one size up or down. For example you can almost always use an m3x10 where an m3x12 is called for. The sizes listed below are what I personally recommend, but you will find people using slightly different sizes in some cases.
I have minimized different sizes as much as possible but I&rsquo;d personally rather have the right size than to make something work. I will continue to minimize the different sizes if possible though.
M2.5 # ℹ️ M2.5 is only needed because the mounting holes on the BTT SKR Pico are M2.5. If you have another mounting solution, or you&rsquo;re willing to drill out the mounting holes on the board to fit M3, then you don&rsquo;t need these.

I will continually update it as I see questions come up.
General FAQ # What is different between v1 and v1.1? # New Toolhead: The toolhead was redevelop from scratch. Compared to v1.0 it&rsquo;s able to push about 65% more air at the critical point directly under the nozzle. New Feet: The new feet are able to absorb 25%-30% more force before the frame starts shaking Removed Rods from the back of the printer: This removed 2 linear rods from the BOM reducing the price of the printer by another 7-10$ Clearance fix for Toolhead: The toolhead is now able to move 5-6mm more in the X-Axis Added allen wrench holes for X/Y-Motors Added Nut-Inserts to the Mainboard Mount Added Clamp to fix Power Cord Made LM8UU Exchangable Added Quickmounts for Z-Rods Bugfix: Power Supply Holder Added cable guides for proper cable management Source
Should I make v1, v1.1, or wait for v2? # I would highly recommend printing v1.1 rather than v1 due to the various quality of life upgrades and fixes that come with v1.1. Note that there are several part differences between the two so you&rsquo;ll need to make sure and print the correct parts for v1.1.
v2, which is currently planned for March 2024, is pretty much going to be a different printer with major design changes. Matt has said there will be a direct drive toolhead and I&rsquo;ve seen mention of potentially having 4wd (4 motors for X/Y movement). I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend waiting for v2; I would definitely go for v1.1.

What is the bed size? # THE 100 uses a 165*165 bed size &ndash; the BOM recommends using an Ender 2 Pro bed.
Can I use a larger bed size? # Matt specifically chose 165*165 as the sweet spot between being large enough, and speed. Increasing the bed size will slow the printer down which isn&rsquo;t the goal of THE 100.
However, there are several 235*235 created by the community in the mods section. For example: one by btlucas, and another by Duncan.

Printing FAQ # Why use PLA / Can I print with some other filament? # Despite what most people think, PLA is extremely rigid. And when you&rsquo;re printing a frame that needs to be stiff&hellip; you want a rigid filament. Other filaments (like PLA+) may be &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; because they&rsquo;re more flexible and can bend without breaking, but bending isn&rsquo;t a good quality in what should be a rigid frame. PLA also has good dampening properties and creates a consistent vibration profile.
Other filaments, like ABS, will work but they have a lower material density than PLA so you will need to increase infill to compensate for that. ASA is another option if you need to withstand higher heat than the printer is originally designed for.
The ultimate answer is that PLA works great for this project, and it&rsquo;s the most affordable, which aligns with the THE 100&rsquo;s goals.

How long does it take to print THE 100? # Details on how long it takes and how much filament is used can be found in the overview.
Buying / Sourcing FAQ # How many fasteners (screws / heat inserts / etc) do I need? # This is the question I&rsquo;ve seen the most and is what lead me to create this whole guide. A grand total can be found here, with individual counts being listed with each particular part (example).
Can I use something other than the Ender 2 Pro bed? # I&rsquo;ve seen several people report not being able to source the Ender 2 Pro bed. I suspect this is a country-specific issue as the vast majority find them readily available on aliexpress or directly from the Ender store. However, check the mods section for various modifications that allow you to use other beds.
For example: Prusa Mini bed by cpx, KP3S bed by MashedPotato, and Ender 3 bed by Overgo.
Does the SD card matter? # I HIGHLY you purchase a quality SD card rather than using a cheap offbrand one. Cheap flash memory could work fine, or it could be the source of constant gremlins that are impossible to chase down. If you find that you have things working and then suddenly they stop&hellip; the SD card is the most likely culprit. A basic 32GB SanDisk ultra can be bought for about $5 on Amazon and will save you so many headaches.
Do I need the wifi antenna for the Banana Pi? # Yes, you definitely need the antenna. I had my BPi within 10 feet of a wifi access point and I still couldn&rsquo;t get internet without an antenna plugged in.
What motors should I get? # The BOM motors # THE 100 BOM currently links to motors that offer 3 options: 17HS4401-XH2.54, 17HS4401-DuPont, and 17HS4401S-DuPont.
-XH2.54 and -DuPont simply refers to the the type of connector that comes on the end of the cable that connects to the mainboard (the SKR Pico).
The white connector is XH2.54 and the black is DuPont. You&rsquo;ll notice in both cases that the cable has at least one white connector. That&rsquo;s because every stepper motor (at least of this type) uses XH2.54 on the motor side. You may also notice that other than the black one being deeper, the pins are spaced out the same.
It does not matter if you get XH2.54 or DuPont as both can plug in to the same connector on the SKR Pico. The benefit of the XH2.54 is that it will give you a tighter fit that is less likely to come out, but it can only be inserted one direction. The benefit of the DuPont is you can flip it over and still insert it, which is helpful since the wiring for stepper motors isn&rsquo;t a standard. You can also change the connector or replace the cable very easily if you want.
For 17HS4401 vs 17HS4401S, this again isn&rsquo;t a standard but in the case of the BOM motors, the S has some silver banding at the top and bottom while the other one is all black.
Other motors # There are countless other motors from other brands that may have identical part numbers but different specs. For example, in other cases the S designates the pinout order. Or the quality of the motor. Or several other things. The only thing you can really do is look at spec sheets to understand what the difference is. Ultimately it likely doesn&rsquo;t matter.
The important part is that you can have a max of 38mm for the z-axis (without mods).
I personally use StepperOnline 17HE15-1504S (for the z-axis) and 17HE19-2004S (for X/Y-axis and Extruder), but there&rsquo;s no reason to think they&rsquo;re better or worse than the ones in the BOM.
What kind of wiring / how much wiring do I need? # The BOM calls for 2 meters of red and black wires, and the question comes up often what it&rsquo;s for and what size to get.
The only planned place to use those wires is to power the SKR Pico off the PSU. At the most that is 200W at 24v, and it&rsquo;s also a short run. Using a standard wire size calculator and inputting wire length as 30cm, the minimum wire size is 21 AWG. Honestly 30cm is longer than needed &ndash; mine are only 20cm long which only requires 23 AWG &ndash; but builds will vary.
With that said, I would recommend going with 18 AWG silicone insulated cables. 18 AWG is more than enough for anything you would use it for in the printer, and the silicone keeps it nice and flexible. And I would recommend going with 2 meters of each color just so you have extra in case you need it.

Then you should watch Matt&rsquo;s video for building the toolhead. This guide will simply function as a supplement to that video.
Notes on the video # The build video for the toolhead is great and covers all steps well.
Tips # There are various qualities of drylins, and how they work with your linear rods will vary. I bought some that were so tight I could barely move them, and others that were super smooth but a bit loose. In the end I actually switched from drylins to linear bearings as I didn&rsquo;t mind the sound difference and they just worked better for me. A nice step to prep your linear rods is to clean them off with alcohol and then use melamine foam (aka magic eraser) and give it a nice quick buff, followed by another wipe down with alcohol. I could barely tell any difference in how smooth the rod was, but I immediately had smoother movements after doing this to all my linear rods. If you haven&rsquo;t built a hot end before (heatsink + heat break + nozzle + nozzle adapter in some cases) then you may run in to issues like I did. It seems like a straightforward process but because I screwed the heat break in first, my nozzle ended up sticking out too far. I didn&rsquo;t realize something was wrong or that this was a problem until I kept getting clogs. This was caused by the heater being too far away from the nozzle. I would suggest putting the nozzle in first so you can get it to the right position (slightly below, but not actually touching, the ceramic heater), then the heatbreak and heatsink. Once you put the orange silicone sock on, the sock should be wrapped around the hex-shape of the nozzle with just the cone shaped tip coming out. If have a lot more sticking out then your nozzle is probably too low. It should go without saying but you need to make sure the heat break is screwed in enough to touch the nozzle. Don&rsquo;t expect this to be the last time you build the toolhead. It will need taken apart to change nozzles, to deal with clogs, to replace your ptfe tube, etc, etc. I think I probably took mine apart at least 10-15 times during the tuning phase. It&rsquo;s annoying at first, but you get faster at it and then it starts to feel like a Formula 1 pit stop.

Getting this part right is critical for the rest of the printer. It&rsquo;s also fun because you will finally get a sense of how the printer will look.
Visit the print &amp; purchase guide for the top frame and for the gantry to see what parts you will need to complete this part of the build.
Then you should watch Matt&rsquo;s video for building the top frame. This guide will simply function as a supplement to that video.
Notes on the video # Matt doesn&rsquo;t really cover what screws he uses in the top frame (they&rsquo;re mostly m3x12 btw). All necessary screws are noted in the print &amp; purchase guide for the top frame. While giving a brief overview of where heat inserts go (1:54), he skips over talking about a few spots. They&rsquo;re shown in the beginning montage but I wanted to mention the ones he doesn&rsquo;t point out: Heat inserts on the back and side where the back frame pieces will attach Heat inserts for the extruder mount Heat inserts for the gantry carriages There is an m3 nut that needs inserted in the belt fasteners BEFORE you insert the bearings (5:23) because you can&rsquo;t fit it in after. If you don&rsquo;t get a tight fit on the nut then you may want to glue it in so it doesn&rsquo;t fall out before needed. Tips # His tip in the video to use a screw to remove the rods if needed is a life saver (3:57). When you insert the m5 screw in the belt fastener (5:23) you don&rsquo;t want the bottom of the screw sticking out of the bottom of the printed part. Just screw it in until the bottom of the screw is flush with the bottom of the part. You will have trouble inserting it in the frame later if it sticks out; there is plenty of extra room at the top where the bolt head is. Repeating what I said about the toolhead build: There are various qualities of drylins, and how they work with your linear rods will vary. I bought some that were so tight I could barely move them, and others that were super smooth but a bit loose. In the end I actually switched from drylins to linear bearings as I didn&rsquo;t mind the sound difference and they just worked better for me. It can be an extremely tight fit to get the x-axis linear rods inserted in to the gantry pieces (6:57 and 9:06). You really need to apply some force to get them inserted all the way. If you don&rsquo;t get them in far enough then you won&rsquo;t be able to get the gantry properly installed. On one of mine I actually used my soldering iron to heat up the end of the rod slightly so it would go in easier (do so at your own risk). If the rods that run in the y-axis (front to back) don&rsquo;t fully seat where they&rsquo;re supposed to go then you likely haven&rsquo;t gotten the x-axis rods fully inserted. It may be easier to take it out of the frame and get both sides really pushed in, then remove the rods from the gantry pieces (see the first tip at the top of this list!) and try installing in the frame again. I mentioned in the toolhead build section that it won&rsquo;t be your last time building the toolhead. This also won&rsquo;t be your last time assembling the gantry as you often have to take the linear rods off to get the toolhead off for maintenance. Don&rsquo;t worry, it gets easier every time you do it.

bottom frame back frame bed Then you should watch Matt&rsquo;s video for building the bottom frame (which includes the back frame and bed). This guide will simply function as a supplement to that video.
Notes on the video # The build video for the bottom frame is great and covers all steps well.
Tips # I created a remix of the cable guides (1:57) that is split so you can run cabling without having to take the guide off the printer. It&rsquo;s also wider to ensure you can fit everything. Available here. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what size screws to get with the bed spring kit (used to attach the heated bed to the printed bed frame). I went with yellow springs and m4x40 screws. The screws were right and the size you want, but it took a LOT of force to get a tiny bit of thread to catch when using the yellow springs. I would recommend either getting something longer than 40mm, or don&rsquo;t use the yellow springs. I ended up switching to old factory springs from my Ender 3 Pro.

A lot of people will follow these steps and it will work great, while others will follow them verbatim and run in to issues. The good news is that unless you&rsquo;re truly doing something wrong, you are definitely not the first person to run in to the issue and help is out there.
This process isn&rsquo;t unique to THE 100. Klipper is used on countless devices, and Raspberry Pi type devices are used in infinitly more. But it does require needing to be somewhat comfortable in a command line environment if you run in to trouble.
Requirements # A BananaPi M2 Zero (aka the SBC) as recommended in the BOM. THE 100 will absolutely work with with a different SBC, but you won&rsquo;t be able to follow the steps exactly. An SD card. I HIGHLY you purchase a quality SD card rather than using a cheap offbrand one. Cheap flash memory could work fine, or it could be the source of constant gremlins that are impossible to chase down. If you find that you have things working and then suddenly they stop&hellip; the SD card is the most likely culprit. A basic 32GB SanDisk ultra can be bought for about $5 on Amazon and will save you so many headaches. A wifi antenna for BPi. It will not connect to the internet without one. A computer and SD card reader. The current guide was written using macOS, but I&rsquo;m working on one for Windows. The steps for a Linux-based computer should match the macOS ones. A micro USB to USB A cable that supports data. Some cables are charging only. A micro USB to USB C cable (or cable with adapter) that supports data. Some cables are charging only. Prep the SD Card # Download Armbian_21.08.1_Bananapim2zero_bullseye_current_5.10.60.img.xz from an armbian archive Direct link ⚠️	It&rsquo;s important that you download this exact version. Others may work, but following the guide exactly will increase your chances of success. Insert your SD card in to your computer and make sure it&rsquo;s recognized Download and install/open Raspberry Pi Imager Select CHOOSE OS &gt; Use custom &gt; select the Armbian_21.08.1_Bananapim2zero_bullseye_current_5.10.60.img.xz file you downloaded earlier (no need to extract it or anything) Click CHOOSE STORAGE and select your SD card Click WRITE ℹ️ The Imager gives you settings you can preconfigure if you click on the gear icon, but they don&rsquo;t actually work in my experience. Don&rsquo;t waste your time. If you get a warning about applying custom settings, say NO When warned that all data will be erased, say YES (I&rsquo;m assuming you made sure you&rsquo;re clearing the correct SD card&hellip; :)) You will need to enter your computer&rsquo;s password for the write to proceed. After the write completes (takes a few minutes) you may get a warning that says The disk you attached was not readable. As long as the Raspberry Pi Imager shows the write was successful then this errors is expected; you can click Eject. If the write wasn&rsquo;t successful, you may have a bad SD card. First armbian boot (macOS) # Insert the SD card in to the BPi. Then plug a micro USB cable in to the OTG plug on the BPi (it&rsquo;s the port closer to the middle; see screenshot below), and the other end in to your computer. Within 20 seconds the red light on the BPi should start blinking. Wait until that point to proceed. From terminal on your mac, type ls /dev/tty.usb* to get a list of attached devices. This should reveal a device that looks similar to /dev/tty.usbmodem21201. Copy that string to notepad before continuing. ℹ️ If you don&rsquo;t get a response to the ls command, make sure you&rsquo;re using a USB cable that supports data and also make sure you&rsquo;re plugged in to the OTG port on the BPi. Open a connection to the BPi by typing screen /dev/tty.usbmodem21201 115200 You need to replace /dev/tty.usbmodem21201 with the string you found in the step above. Do not change 115200 at the end of the string. ℹ️ If you get a blank screen and you can&rsquo;t type or do anything, you should try a different USB cable and try connecting to a different USB port on your computer. The only time I&rsquo;ve seen this is when I was using a USB hub or cable that didn&rsquo;t properly support this type of connection. You should now see a prompt for the BPi M2. It should look like what you would see if the BPi was connected to a monitor. Set the root password by typing a password twice It will warn you if it isn&rsquo;t secure enough and make you type it again Type 1 to select bash as your default shell When prompted to provide a username, enter klipper. Then enter a password for the klipper user. You can leave the real name as Klipper when prompted Type exit to log out of the root user. You should now be sitting at a login prompt. Enter klipper as the user, and the password you set for the klipper user. You should now be logged in as the klipper user. Setup wifi # Prior to continuing, you should be logged in as the klipper user and sitting at a prompt that says klipper@bananapim2zero:~$
Type nmtui and press enter to launch the Network Manager Arrow down to select Activate a connection and hit enter Arrow down to your wifi SSID and hit enter ℹ️ If you don&rsquo;t see any wifi access points, you likely don&rsquo;t have the BPi antenna connected. In my experience you MUST have the antenna to proceed. I had a high powered wifi AP sitting 10 feet from the BPi and it couldn&rsquo;t find it. This is my neighbors ssid, I just thought the name was funny Enter your wifi password when prompted If things worked as expected you should see a * in front of your ssid. And if you arrow down to it so it&rsquo;s highlighted, the button on the top right should now show Deactivate. Press tab until you get to &lt;Back&gt; and hit enter Arrow down to Quit and hit enter Type /sbin/ifconfig wlan0|grep inet to see the IP address that your BPi was assigned Mine is 192.168.1.120 ℹ️ It would be smart to set a static IP as this one is assigned dynamically and is likely to change. I won&rsquo;t be covering how to do that in this guide. Connect via SSH # Open a new command prompt/terminal on your computer (it&rsquo;s important you don&rsquo;t do this in the BPi terminal) and type ssh klipper@192.168.1.120 (but replace my IP with yours that you found in the step above!) If you receive a prompt asking you if you&rsquo;re sure you want to continue connecting, type yes and hit enter Type the password you created for the klipper user above You should now be connected to the BPi via ssh! Shutdown # From this point on it&rsquo;s important that you don&rsquo;t just unplug your BPi without properly shutting it down (unless you have no choice). It is a computer and simply unplugging it can often lead to corruption or other issues.
Type sudo shutdown now You will likely see a prompt telling you that you&rsquo;re trusted and to follow 3 things. This is because sudo is giving you admin access to the BPi Enter your klipper user password when prompt and hit enter Your ssh connection should drop and the LED on the BPi will be solid red. It is now safe to unplug. If you got this far then armbian is setup then your user is setup, the device is online, and you&rsquo;re ready to continue! Let&rsquo;s get klipper setup.

It reads gcode and passes it along to the printer control board (the SKR Pico). In this step we&rsquo;ll not only install klipper, but also moonraker and fluidd which are used for being able to remotely manage klipper and your printer.
Requirements # Your Banana Pi (or similar SBC) should have Armbian 21.08.1 with kernel 5.10.60 installed If you followed the steps in my previous armbian guide then you&rsquo;re all set The last step in my armbian guide had you shutdown the BPi. That&rsquo;s because we need to move the power cable from the OTG USB port (the one closer to the middle) to the power-only USB port (the one closest to the side). You can still plug the cable in to your computer for power, but if you have a quality USB wall plug, I would recommend using that instead.
Plug power in and wait until the red light is flashing to proceed.
SSH # Open a command prompt/terminal on your computer and type ssh klipper@192.168.1.120 (but replace my IP with yours) If it has been a significant amount of time since you setup the BPi, and you didn&rsquo;t configure a static IP, then the IP may have changed since you last knew it. You will need to find the new IP to proceed. Enter the password for the klipper user and you should find yourself at a familiar prompt that says klipper@bananapim2zero:~$ KIAUH # KIAUH (Klipper Installation And Update Helper) is a script that assists you in installing Klipper. It&rsquo;s the easiest method to get things going.
Install Klipper # Type git clone https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh.git to copy the KIAUH repo to your BPi Type ./kiauh/kiauh.sh to start the install You should now see the main menu Type 1 and hit enter for the install menu You may be prompted for your klipper user password. Type it and hit enter. Type 1 and hit enter to install Klipper itself Type 1 and hit enter to select Python 3.x as the Python version Type 1 and hit enter to indicate you only want one instance of Klipper The Klipper install process will now begin. Be patient. There is a lot of data for it to download, extract, and install so expect this to take some time. If anything gets interrupted during this process then you will need to start back from the beginning. Once complete you should see \`\`, and you will then be returned to the installation menu. Install Moonraker # Klipper on its own just runs locally on the BPi and doesn&rsquo;t give you the ability to manage or control it remotely. Moonraker is a web server that exposes APIs so you (or more practically, your slicer) can interact with Klipper. Note that this is different from a web UI like mainsail or fluidd which we&rsquo;ll also be installing. But those UIs also rely on Moonraker.
From the installation menu, type 2 for Moonraker and hit enter You will be asked if you want to install Moonraker. Type Y and hit enter. Once again, be patient. This is a large install that takes time. When the install completes you will see Moonraker has been set up! and be returned to the install menu It will also show you the IP and port of the running instance of Moonraker. You can copy/paste that in to your web browser and you should see Welcome to Moonraker. You can&rsquo;t actually do anything further from that page, but it&rsquo;s nice to see. Install Fluidd (or mainsail) # Fluidd or mainsail are two very popular options that provide a user interface to Klipper. They are forks of the same software, work nearly the same, and if you understand one then you&rsquo;ll understand the other. I personally use mainsail on one of my printers and fluidd in another. I maybe like fluidd better but they&rsquo;re so similar that it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. Matt install fluidd in his video so I&rsquo;m going to stick with that just to keep things consistent.
Select 4 and hit enter to install Fluidd Again, you&rsquo;re welcome to install Mainsail instead. It&rsquo;s a different flavor of the same thing. You just won&rsquo;t be able to follow along with future screenshots. After a minute or so you&rsquo;ll e asked if you want to download the recommended macros. Type Y and hit enter. A few seconds later it is done. It should say Fluidd has been set up! at the top and you should be back at the install menu Optional: in your web browser you can go to 192.168.1.120 (replace with your IP!) and you should see the fluidd web interface. It will display an error and not be functional yet, but it should load Back to the command prompt, type B and hit enter to go back Type &lsquo;Q\` and hit enter to quit You should be back at the klipper@bananapim2zero:~$ prompt before continuing Input shaper requirements # The software needed to run input shaper isn&rsquo;t installed by default. We will install them manually.
You should be at the klipper@bananapim2zero:~$ prompt Type sudo apt install python3-numpy python3-matplotlib libatlas-base-dev -y and hit enter This will take a few minutes to complete Type pip3 install oldest-supported-numpy ℹ️ In Matt&rsquo;s video he specifies installing numpy v1.18, but that version is now giving errors to a lot of people. Use the above command instead. As of this type, the above command will install v1.19.3. I have tested and verified it works as expected with the calibrate_shaper scripts from klipper. This will take quite a while to complete and may appear frozen at times.

In order for that to be possible, we have to get the BPi and the SKR Pico talking to each other.

I have now also included how to do it by retrieving the generated firmware via fluidd, and then use your computer to flash the SKR. This method is near foolproof and is now the recommended option. In either case, you need to set some jumpers on the SKR first.
SKR jumpers # Ensure you have jumpers on the SKR Pico to unlock the bootloader (the yellow highlighted one near the middle) and to enable USB power (near the corner by the USB port)
Option 1: use fluidd and your computer (recommended) # In the SSH session on your BPi, type cp ~/klipper/out/klipper.uf2 ~/printer_data/config/klipper.uf2 and hit In your web browser, go to the IP of your BPi. This should load the fluidd web UI. Click Configuration on the left side, then under Configuration Files click on klipper.uf2 and click Download. This will save the compiled firmware to your computer Plug the SKR Pico in to your computer. It will show up as an external drive, just like a USB flash drive If it doesn&rsquo;t show up then either your jumpers aren&rsquo;t set correctly on the SKR, or the cable you&rsquo;re using is power only and doesn&rsquo;t support data Drag and drop the downloaded klipper.uf2 file on to the mounted drive The SKR will reboot automatically which indicates it received the firmware and has flashed it. It will then reconnect as an external drive. If you look at the files on the drive, klipper.uf2 should no longer be there. That&rsquo;s a good thing and indicates a success. Wait a few seconds and then eject the drive, then unplug the SKR from your computer. Remove the jumper you put on the SKR Pico earlier (the one in the middle of the board) that puts it in to bootloader mode Your SKR firmware is now flashed! Jump down to UART to continue.
Option 2: use BPi connected to SKR # Skip these steps and go down to UART if you already followed option 1.
Connect a cable from the OTG USB port on the BPi (the USB port closer to the middle) to the USB C port on the SKR Pico The SKR Pico should have a solid red light. Wait about 30 seconds before proceeding. Type ls /dev/sda* and hit enter. You should get a response similar to the one below. If you don&rsquo;t, wait 30 seconds and try again. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, do sudo reboot now, then wait about 1 minute for everything to come back online. ssh to your BPi (step 4 above) and try again. If you still don&rsquo;t see anything then you either don&rsquo;t have the firmware jumper put on, or the USB cable you&rsquo;re using between the BPi and the SKR Pico doesn&rsquo;t support data. Or you&rsquo;re an unlucky one that this process just isn&rsquo;t going to work for you. Use option 1 above instead. Continuing from the previous section, you should be at the klipper@bananapim2zero:~/klipper$ prompt sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt and hit sudo cp out/klipper.uf2 /mnt and hit sudo umount /mnt and hit You won&rsquo;t see anything happen while the SKR Pico is flashed. This process happens automatically after you umount. Before continuing we want to confirm the SKR Pico is done flashing. Type ls /dev/sda* and hit enter. You should get a response similar to the one below (this is the same step you repeated earlier). If you don&rsquo;t, wait 30 seconds and try again. Doing this shows that the SKR has rebooted and reconnected which means the firmware update has completed Unplug the USB cable that goes between the BPi and the SKR Pico We won&rsquo;t need this cable anymore Remove the jumper you put on the SKR Pico earlier (the one in the middle of the board) that puts it in to bootloader mode UART # Note: There are some added steps here compared to Matt&rsquo;s video. The process is the same but these added steps give you several checks along the way to verify things are working as expected. That way if they aren&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s easier to identify where the problem is.

The first red wire should be connected to pin 2 on the BPi, with the green wire connected to pin 10. The connector on the Pico side only goes one direction. USB cable between BPi and SKR should not be connected Power on the BPi. The SKR Pico should power on as well. If it doesn&rsquo;t, something is wrong with header pins or direction of UART. In your web browser, go to the IP of your BPi. This should load the fluidd website. If it doesn&rsquo;t load, wait a minute and try again.

Doing it wrong won&rsquo;t break anything (aside from your patience and mental stability), but knowing why it&rsquo;s wrong and how to fix it is critical for moving forward with the printer.
Requirements # Your motors, the cables to connect them, and your motor technical sheets Understanding movement # I set out to write a guide on how to get the printer moving, and how to troubleshoot it when it inevitably wasn&rsquo;t working on your first try. But as I wrote it I realized more and more that I needed to explain motor wiring and how CoreXY printers work in general. If you&rsquo;re super experienced with stepper motors and CoreXY printers then you can skip to the next section, but I highly recommend reading through this.
I&rsquo;ve kept things as simple as I could, while providing enough detail to help you get your printer working! This is one of the most common places that people get stuck and frustrated, so take the time now to understand it before you start doing it.
CoreXY basics # I&rsquo;m not using this as a spot to explain why a CoreXY printer is better than cartesian &ndash; or to even say that it actually is better for that matter &ndash; it&rsquo;s just important to understand how they&rsquo;re different.
A cartesian printer (there&rsquo;s a million of them but think: Ender 3, Prusa MK3, etc, etc, etc) most often has a single motor that controls movement on the X axis, a single motor that controls movement on the Y axis, and a single motor that controls movement on the Z axis. That means if you&rsquo;re building or troubleshooting movement on one, it&rsquo;s super obvious that if it won&rsquo;t move in the X-direction then it&rsquo;s something with the X motor. Or if the Y-direction moves the opposite of how you expect then it&rsquo;s the Y motor.
With a CoreXY printer, movement in the X or Y direction actually requires two separate motors working together. So if your printer isn&rsquo;t moving in the X-direction, it could be either motor causing it. Or if the Y-direction is reversed, it could be either motor. It makes things more complex, but the good news is that troubleshooting this is easy if you take it slow and pay attention to how things should be working.
It&rsquo;s worth mentioning here that while people still often refer to motors on a CoreXY printer as the X motor and the Y motor, it often makes more sense to refer to them as A and B to prevent your brain from thinking that a single motor controls a single direction. But you&rsquo;ll still see references to X and Y everywhere so there isn&rsquo;t really any avoiding it.
Stepper motor basics # Without getting too deep in to the details, it&rsquo;s important to understand how a stepper motor works so that you can figure out how to wire one up. I&rsquo;m keeping this as simple as possible so again, if you&rsquo;re super knowledgable with stepper motors then you&rsquo;ll probably want to correct me on stuff, but this isn&rsquo;t meant to be a class on elecromagnetism (unless you want it to be&hellip;).
Your stepper motor has a shaft sticking out of it. This is the part that you see spinning around. Inside the motor, that shaft is attached to a magnetized rotor. In a circle around the shaft/rotor are sets of electronic magnets. The shaft/rotor can&rsquo;t actually touch the magnets around it, but they&rsquo;re close enough that they&rsquo;re attracted to each other. Like 2 magnets that want to snap together.
Remember from grade school that all magnets have a north and south pole, and that opposite poles attract each other while matching poles repel each other? That&rsquo;s exactly how this works. One set of electromagnets is energized which causes the magnetic shaft/rotor to be attracted to it. Now that set is turned off and the next set is turned on; this causes the shaft to rotate due to magnetic attraction. Now repeat that a bunch of times and the shaft will rotate in a circle. Repeat the process but turn the magnets on in the opposite direction and your motor will turn in the other direction.
Here is a top-down view of the motor. The shaft is sticking up towards the camera, attached to the rotor that you see spinning as the different magnet groups are electrified (gif source):
Stepper motor wiring # Hopefully I haven&rsquo;t lost you yet. Stick with me a little longer! We&rsquo;re going to get a little more advanced here but I promise it&rsquo;s easy.
I explained that to explain this: the 4 wires that come out of your stepper motor are used to power the series of magnets inside the motor. Power them on in one sequence and it spins clockwise, the oposite sequence and its counter-clockwise. Power them incorrectly and it won&rsquo;t work at all because the magnet isn&rsquo;t generated. Therefore, it&rsquo;s important to get the wires from the motor to your SKR Pico in the correct order. The problem with that is the wire order isn&rsquo;t standardized or consistent. You must look at the diagram for your motor to determine the pinout order, and use that to ensure it matches what the Pico wants.
Every motor is going to have two wires for A and two wires for B. If you look at the spec sheet for your motor (note: you must look at the sheet for your exact motor!), there will be a diagram that shows the pinout.
Here is a screenshot from mine, model 17HE19-2004S from Stepper Online:
Notice at the bottom it says A+ B+ A- B-? That indicates that pin 1 is the positive wire for A, pin 2 is positive for B, pin 3 is negative for A, and pin 4 is negative for B. And again, for a refresher, the Pico would send power down these 4 pins in sequence to cause the motor shaft to turn one direction or the other. Ok&hellip; great! We have our pin order and we have at least some idea how this is supposed to work. Hopefully. :)
SKR Pico wiring # Here&rsquo;s the last of the technical bits, and it&rsquo;s easier than the stuff above. The SKR Pico expects the motor wires to be in the following order A+ A- B+ B-. The good news here is you can reverse the A and B groups and things will still work (it will possibly spin in the wrong direction but that&rsquo;s a simple fix in klipper and is covered in the next section), but it&rsquo;s important that A is grouped together as +/- and B is grouped as +/-.
If you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, my motor is a problem because it goes ABAB. If I were to just plug it up as-is to the Pico then nothing would work because the magnets won&rsquo;t be properly powered. The fix is very easy though. Rather than leaving the cable how it is where pin 1 on the motor would connect to pin 1 on the Pico, pin 2 to 2, etc, I just need to pull pins 2 and 3 from one end of the cable and reverse them. This doesn&rsquo;t require any special tools other than a small poker (a paperclip will do).
This pin swap is extremely easy to do regardless of your connector style. Just do a quick search on how to remove a pin based on the style you have and you&rsquo;ll be all set.
By making that change I haven&rsquo;t actually done anything to the motor itself; the pins on the motor are still A+ B+ A- B-, but the order they&rsquo;re actually connected to the Pico in becomes A+ A- B+ B-.
Ok&hellip; Hopefully I covered that in enough detail to explain it, but not so much that you&rsquo;re more confused than when you started. As always, let me know if you have questions or suggestions. Class is adjourned! Take a quick break and then let&rsquo;s get your printer gantry moving!
`}),e.add({id:36,href:"/T100-wiki/the100v11/configure/gantry_movement/",title:"First gantry movement",description:"How to get your THE 100 moving for the first time in the XY direction",content:`It&rsquo;s (about to be) alive! # If you have been following along then you now have your printer to a point that things are wired up, the BananaPi and SKR Pico are connected, and you can access the fluidd/mainsail UI without any errors. Now the fun begins&hellip; seeing your printer move for the first time!
ℹ️ This guide doesn't go in to detail yet on how to wire everything to the SKR Pico. Making that guide is on my to do list, but for now it's just assumed that you have things plugged in. Requirements # You have your A/B (aka X/Y) motors plugged in to your SKR Pico You have access to fluidd/mainsail and it&rsquo;s connecting to your printer with no errors You have an understanding of CoreXY printers, motor wiring, and you have modified your cables as needed I would recommend starting with no belt, or at least having it loose enough to allow the motor pulleys to rotate without moving the belt. This way you can test and verify both motors are working as expected without risk of crashing your printhead. 🛑	Skipping steps and not slowly iterating will result in you getting increasingly frustrated. It's important to make one change at a time, test one thing at a time, and document your progress as you go. If you've made it this far then you're doing great! But for those that have never setup a printer like this before, this is where a lot of frustration will come if you aren't patient and methodical about your setup. Wiring # This guide doesn&rsquo;t cover wiring in detail, but it is important that you have your A/B (aka X/Y) motors plugged in before you continue or you&rsquo;ll just get errors. Every motor is different so how mine is wired won&rsquo;t necessarily be how yours should be wired. But you knew that already&hellip; right?
However, to save some trouble, you should have:
Your left motor plugged in to the Y plug on SKR Your right motor to X plug on SKR pico Perspective # Because we&rsquo;ll be talking about left/right and clockwise/counter-clockwise, it&rsquo;s important to establish our perspective. Like a sane person, I&rsquo;ll be treating everything as if we&rsquo;re looking at the front of the printer from up above. Even still, it can be confusing for some to understand &ldquo;clockwise&rdquo; for the motor shaft when it&rsquo;s actually pointed down. Just imagine there&rsquo;s a little clock sitting on top of the motor, and visualize what direction the shaft is moving underneith.
My method of printer configuration # Matt has a completed printer.cfg published on GitHub, but I recommend building your printer.cfg up in stages. This allows you to get individual pieces established and working, rather than trying to troubleshoot the whole cfg at once. Not to mention that Matt&rsquo;s config is written for his specific printer and is for once the printer is fully working. I highly suggest you follow my process, rather than copy/pasting his whole config at once. You&rsquo;ll learn more this way, and be in a better place to troubleshoot when needed.
Fluidd # I use both Fluidd and Mainsail on my builds, and I like them both. Matt&rsquo;s videos initially mention Fluidd so I&rsquo;m sticking with that for this guide. If you&rsquo;re using Mainsail instead then the steps will be nearly identical, but the screenshots and printer.cfg won&rsquo;t match exactly.
Reminder: you access fluidd/mainsail by going to the IP address of your BananaPi in your web browser. Then click on the configuration icon on the left side and click on printer.cfg to open it in the editor.
Add A/B (X/Y) motors to cfg # If you have been following along with my guides then your printer.cfg should currently look like this:

Simple motor tests # We&rsquo;re now ready to send some simple commands to the A/B motors to make sure that:
They&rsquo;re plugged in to the right ports on the SKR Pico They&rsquo;re wired correctly They&rsquo;re spinning the correct directions 🛑	In case you skipped the requirements above: your belt should not be attached to the motors right now. You're risking breaking things if it is. You will send the following commands using the console in Fluidd, and observe what the motors do. Reminder that for clockwise/counter-clockwise, it&rsquo;s from the perspective of you looking down at the motors from up above. Check the screenshot at the top if you&rsquo;re confused.
Test right motor # Positive direction # FORCE_MOVE STEPPER=stepper_x DISTANCE=300 VELOCITY=30 ACCEL=300

Test X direction # Our previous tests moved one motor at a time. Despite being labeled stepper_x and stepper_y, if you had the belt connected then the printhead would have actually been moving diagonal. Let&rsquo;s test movement of both motors now.

Fixes # No fixes should be necessary if you followed the steps above. Return to the top and start again. Test Y direction # Pretty interesting to see both motors turn despite only telling it to move on one axis, right? Now let&rsquo;s repeat for Y.
Positive Y # SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION X=50 Y=50 Z=50 G91 G1 y100 F1000 Expected: Left motor turns counter-clockwise, right motor turns clockwise

Time to see the gantry move! # Completing all those tests without the belts on allows for much easier troubleshooting since it&rsquo;s clear what the motors are doing. Once they&rsquo;re done, you are ready to string and tighten the belt!
When your belt is routed and tightened, physically move the printhead to the middle of the gantry and ensure the bed is low enough that the printhead won&rsquo;t hit it. And then&hellip;
SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION X=50 Y=50 Z=50 G91 G1 x10 F1000 # should move to the right G1 x-10 F1000 # should move to the left G1 y10 F1000 # should move towards the back G1 y-10 F1000 # should move towards the front You really shouldn&rsquo;t have any failures here if you completed all the previous steps. If things aren&rsquo;t moving in the correct direction, or if they&rsquo;re moving diagonal, take the belt off again and start back at the top.

If you end up breaking your cfg in future steps, or if your SD card gets corrupted, or anything else like that... you'll be glad you have this saved! I highly recommend repeating this process any time you make important cfg changes. Now let&rsquo;s move on to getting the Z axis going!

Let&rsquo;s get that going now!
Requirements # You completed the steps in the gantry movement guide, and your printer.cfg is in the state it was left in at the end of that guide. You have both of your Z-axis motors plugged in to your SKR Pico You have access to fluidd/mainsail and it&rsquo;s connecting to your printer with no errors You have an understanding of CoreXY printers, motor wiring, and you have modified your cables as needed Just like I recommend not having the belt attached when you&rsquo;re first testing the gantry motors, I would recommend starting this process with either your Z motors not actually installed in the frame, or with the lead screw nuts disconnected from the bed so the rods can spin without actually moving the bed. Lead screws should be attached to the Z motors with the couplers. It&rsquo;s important this is done so you can verify they aren&rsquo;t wobbling while testing motion. Wiring # One important thing to understand about the SKR Pico is that while it has two separate outputs for two Z motors, they share the same driver. That means the power and everything is split in two. Typically the Z motors don&rsquo;t require nearly as much power as A/B motors because they don&rsquo;t move as much, but this is just something to be aware of.
Perspective # Just like the A/B motors, it&rsquo;s important to establish our perspective. Like a sane person, I&rsquo;ll be treating everything as if we&rsquo;re looking at the front of the printer from up above. Keep in mind that the Z motors are mounted facing up, so clockwise/counter-clockwise is reversed from the A/B motors which face down. Just look at everything from up above.
Simple motor tests # We&rsquo;re now ready to send some simple commands to the Z motors to make sure that:
They&rsquo;re plugged in to the right ports on the SKR Pico They&rsquo;re wired correctly They&rsquo;re spinning the correct directions The lead screws are staying straight 🛑	In case you skipped the requirements above: your Z motors should either not actually be installed in the frame, or the lead screw nuts should be disconnected from the bed so the rods can spin without actually moving the bed.

If the motors spin in opposite directions Because the Z motors use a shared driver, this can only happen if your wiring is different between the two motors. Check the wiring on the one that is spinning counter-clockwise and make sure your other motor matches it. If no motor rotates Check your motor wiring and that you have it plugged in to the correct port If the lead screws are wobbling Make sure the lead screws themselves are straight (easier to do if they aren&rsquo;t already attached). But more likely it means they aren&rsquo;t sitting straight up and down in the coupler. Loosen the coupler and get it perfectly straight, then tighten and retest. You need it to be as straight as possible to prevent binding when the bed moves. Negative direction # SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION X=50 Y=50 Z=30 G91 G1 Z-20 F100 Expected: both motors should rotate clockwise, and the lead screws should not be wobbling at all.

Time to move the bed! # Completing those tests without the bed allows for much easier troubleshooting since it&rsquo;s clear what the motors are doing. Go ahead and get the motors installed in the frame now, and thread them in to the tightened lead screw nuts. It doesn&rsquo;t matter which motor goes on which side.
Using both hands to spin each lead screw at the same time, adjust the bed so you have at least 40mm between the top of the printed bed to the bottom of the top frame.
Once you get it to roughly 40mm, use a caliper or something similar to actually measure the distance. This will be important coming up.
SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION X=50 Y=50 Z=40 G91 G1 Z-20 F100 You really shouldn&rsquo;t have any failures here if you completed all the previous steps, but there is a critical final step: validate your screw pitch. Different lead screws will move the bed a different distance. Re-measure the distance between your bed and the top of the frame and verify it is now 20mm less than your first measurement. If it&rsquo;s close, that&rsquo;s fine. If it&rsquo;s way off, you will need to make changes to rotation_distance. I&rsquo;m skipping describing that further now so hopefully yours was right! Please @ me on discord if yours wasn&rsquo;t.

Spoiler alert: there&rsquo;s a few things we have to do first&hellip;
`}),e.add({id:38,href:"/T100-wiki/the100v11/configure/sensorless_homing/",title:"Sensorless homing prep",description:"How to calibrate your setup for sensorless homing in Klipper",content:`Homing # Homing is the process your printer completes to determine the printhead&rsquo;s location in all 3 dimensions. Traditionally this is done using a limit switch on each axis, but THE 100 uses a new process that doesn&rsquo;t require the switches &ndash; that&rsquo;s where the name &ldquo;sensorless&rdquo; comes from. The primary benefit is it reduces the cost and some complexity of the build itself, but it does add extra configuration steps.
Sensorless homing # Sensorless homing is a Klipper feature where it moves the carriage and bed until they hit the frame of the printer. Once that happens, the stepper motor loses steps. The stepper driver senses those lost steps which Klipper can then use to know that it has hit the end of the axis. Other than that, it works the same way as a limit switch.
Requirements # You have completed the gantry movement and bed movement guides, and your printer.cfg matches how we ended the bed movement guide. Know how to do an emergency stop in fluidd/mainsail so you can immediately stop the homing process if your stepper driver doesn&rsquo;t properly report a stall. This will help prevent damage to the printer and motion systems. 🛑	Skipping steps and not slowly iterating will result in you getting increasingly frustrated. It's important to make one change at a time, test one thing at a time, and document your progress as you go. If you've made it this far then you're doing great! But for those that have never setup a printer like this before, this is where a lot of frustration will come if you aren't patient and methodical about your setup. Relevant printer.cfg sections # If you have been following my configuration guide then these already exist in your printer.cfg, but it&rsquo;s still important you understand what options are doing what so you can troubleshoot them later if needed.
The examples below are just snippets of the config
[stepper_x] endstop_pin: tmc2209_stepper_x:virtual_endstop # Use a virtual endstop homing_retract_dist: 0 # Don't find the endstop, then retract and find it again. Just do it once. [tmc2209 stepper_x] diag_pin: ^gpio4 # The pin your stepper driver diagnostic output is connected to driver_SGTHRS: 115 # The stallguard threshold / sensitivity level Similar options are repeated for stepper_y and stepper_z.
Stallguard threshold aka driver_SGTHRS # When your axis hits the printer frame and reports the missed steps back to the MCU via the diagnostic pin as described above, it reports a stallguard value. A very high / very sensitive value, like 255, will trigger simply from the friction of the motor moving. A very low / least sensitive value, like 0, will likely never trigger since your motor will likely overpower your belt.
The goal for this part of the guide is to find the right stallguard value for your setup so that it detects when your axis has hit the frame without triggering too early or too late. It&rsquo;s important to note that this value can change if you make changes to your motor current, homing speed, load on the printer, and some other variables. So if you find your homing process stops working while you continue tuning the printer, you may need to revisit this guide and re-tune driver_SGTHRS.
Enough talking, let&rsquo;s get tuning! # The process for determining your stallguard threshold involves setting it to the highest value, then continuing to lower it until it stops as expected. It&rsquo;s generally recommended to only lower the value by 5-10 at a time, however you start at 255 and most motors will require something around 100, so I personally make bigger jumps at first to save time. Then once you start to get around the right number, make smaller steps.
Just be ready with the emergency stop button in case you go too far and it&rsquo;s causing the axis to repeatedly crash in to the frame.
🛑	If your printer.cfg isn't following this guide exactly then the G28 command may not work as described. In particular if you are using the printer.cfg from Matt's github then you should be able to replace G28 with G280 in the commands below, but I'm not going to cover that further as the recommendation here is to follow all parts of this guide. Be sure to wait a few seconds between each G28 X0 command. After the driver detects a stall it may take a little time for it to clear its internal indicator and be capable of detecting another stall.
X-axis # With your printer powered on, physically move the printhead to the center of the X and Y axis so it&rsquo;s over the middle of your bed. Issue the following commands using your fluidd/mainsail console
SET_TMC_FIELD FIELD=SGTHRS STEPPER=stepper_x VALUE=255 G28 X0 This temporarily overrides your cfg and sets the stallguard value to 255, and it then tries to home the X axis. It&rsquo;s expected that the gantry moves a tiny amount but stops almost immediately. If it moves all the way to the frame then you should immediately hit the stop button. You either have an issue with your diag pin wiring, or you aren&rsquo;t using a TMC2209 stepper driver.
If the motor moves a tiny amount and then stops, let&rsquo;s save time and jump to a lower threshold.
SET_TMC_FIELD FIELD=SGTHRS STEPPER=stepper_x VALUE=200 G28 X0 If it moved a tiny amount and then stopped (most likely), continue with the next step If it moved to the end of the frame and stopped, jump to fine tuning If it moved to the end of the frame and didn&rsquo;t immediately stop, increase the VALUE until it stops when it collides, then jump to fine tuning. SET_TMC_FIELD FIELD=SGTHRS STEPPER=stepper_x VALUE=170 G28 X0 If it moved a tiny amount then stopped (most likely), you should continue repeating the steps above but lower the VALUE in increments of 10. So the next steps would be 160, 150, 140, etc. You may need to disable the motors and physically move the printhead back to the center of the print bed if it is getting too close to the frame due to the number of tests it is taking to find the right value for your motors. Eventually you will find a low enough number where the printhead moves all the way to the frame and then stops once it bumps it. You should now jump to fine tuning. If it moved to the end of the frame and stopped, jump to fine tuning If it moved to the end of the frame and didn&rsquo;t immediately stop, increase the VALUE until it stops when it collides, then jump to fine tuning. Fine tuning X-axis # You found the value where stallguard stops homing once the carriage hit the frame&hellip; excellent! But we still need to do a little more tuning. There is a range of values where it will stop and we don&rsquo;t currently know if you&rsquo;re at the top or bottom of that range. Our goal here is to get somewhere in the middle so small changes to your printer won&rsquo;t break homing.
As mentioned above, be sure to wait a few seconds between each G28 X0 command. After the driver detects a stall it may take a little time for it to clear its internal indicator and be capable of detecting another stall. You may also need to disable the motors and physically move the printhead back to the center if you&rsquo;re getting too close to the frame.
Max value # Our first step here is to increase your value by 10 and test. This is increasing sensitivity meaning it&rsquo;s likely to move slightly and then stop. Move the printhead back to the center of the bed, then replace VALUE with the actual value you found above +10. In my example I&rsquo;m going to start with 120 for my printer because the value I found above was 110. Yours will very likely be different.
SET_TMC_FIELD FIELD=SGTHRS STEPPER=stepper_x VALUE=120 G28 X0 If it stops right away (mine did) then you know the value you found before is the upper threshold of your printer. For me that means 110 but again, yours will likely be different. Continue to min value. If it moves all the way to the frame and then stops, you aren&rsquo;t at your upper threshold yet. Increase the value by another 5 and then repeat until it stops right away. Then continue to the next step. Min value # The process is the same, but we want to decrease values of 10 to find the lower threshold. Our goal here isn&rsquo;t to push it to the point of crashing the toolhead in to the frame and grinding the belt, but to find the value where it homes without a large bang or click.
Move the printhead back to the center of the bed, then replace VALUE with the value you found above minus 10. In my example I&rsquo;m going to start with 100 for my printer because the value I found above was 110. Yours will very likely be different.
SET_TMC_FIELD FIELD=SGTHRS STEPPER=stepper_x VALUE=100 G28 X0 If it moves to the end and stops just as quietly as it did before, subtract another 10 (decrease sensitivity) and repeat until you find your minimum value. Again, you aren&rsquo;t trying to find a point where it reaches the frame and then keeps going. That means you&rsquo;ve pushed it way too far. You&rsquo;re just trying to find where it makes a louder bang or click than it had before. If it moves all the way to the frame and makes a loud bang, add 5 (increase sensitivity) to your value and repeat until it stops quietly. For me that value is 70.
If you&rsquo;re starting to get to numbers that are 50 or more lower than your max value then your ears likely aren&rsquo;t picking up the difference in how it sounds when it stops. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend continuing to go lower as it doesn&rsquo;t benefit you any.
Setting the value # I now know my max value is 110 and my minimum value is 70, meaning the middle is 90. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll set as my new value. Update your printer.cfg in the correct section to match your value, then save and restart.
[tmc2209 stepper_x] driver_SGTHRS: 90 Now we&rsquo;ll repeat the same process for Y and Z!
Y-axis # The process for the Y-axis is exactly with the same except we&rsquo;ll update our commands to use stepper_y and to home the Y axis rather than X. I&rsquo;m not going to go in to as much detail as I did above because it would be redundant. Refer to the steps above as needed.
With your printer powered on, physically move the printhead to the center of the X and Y axis so it&rsquo;s over the middle of your bed. Issue the following commands using your fluidd/mainsail console
SET_TMC_FIELD FIELD=SGTHRS STEPPER=stepper_y VALUE=255 G28 Y0 This should move a tiny amount and then stop. Repeat the steps above until you find the value where it moves on the y-axis until it hits the frame and then stops. I would save time by initially making some big jumps by changing VALUE 200, then 170, then 150. At that point I would start moving in increments of 10: 140, 130, 120, etc until you get it to move to the frame.
As mentioned above, be sure to wait a few seconds between each G28 Y0 command. After the driver detects a stall it may take a little time for it to clear its internal indicator and be capable of detecting another stall. You may also need to disable the motors and physically move the printhead back to the center if you&rsquo;re getting too close to the frame.
Once you find a good VALUE, repeat the steps outlined above for max value and min value; just don&rsquo;t forget to update the commands to reference stepper_y instead of stepper_x, and Y0 instead of X0.
Setting the value # At this point you should know the max and min values for your Y axis. Pick a value in the middle of the two and then update the relevant section of your printer.cfg. Then save and restart.
[tmc2209 stepper_y] driver_SGTHRS: 95 Z-axis # The process for the Z-axis is exactly with the same as the Y-axis, which was exactly the same as the X-axis. Except, of course, we&rsquo;ll update our commands to use stepper_z and to home the Z axis. I&rsquo;m going to go in to even less detail than before. Refer to the steps above as needed.
Important change for Z-axis: ensure your toolhead is pushed all the way back so the bed doesn&rsquo;t collide with your nozzle while it homes.
With your printer powered on, physically move the printhead to the back frame. Then turn the lead screws so there is a decent gap between the top of the bed and the top frame (40mm or so). Issue the following commands using your fluidd/mainsail console
SET_TMC_FIELD FIELD=SGTHRS STEPPER=stepper_z VALUE=255 G28 Z0 This should move a tiny amount and then stop. Repeat the steps above until you find the value where the bed moves up until it hits the frame and then stops.
As mentioned above, be sure to wait a few seconds between each G28 Z0 command. After the driver detects a stall it may take a little time for it to clear its internal indicator and be capable of detecting another stall. You may also need to disable the motors and physically move the bed back down if you&rsquo;re getting too close to the frame.
Once you find a good VALUE, repeat the steps outlined above for max value and min value; just don&rsquo;t forget to update the commands to reference stepper_z Z0.
Setting the value # At this point you should know the max and min values for your Z axis. Pick a value in the middle of the two and then update the relevant section of your printer.cfg. Then save and restart.
[tmc2209 stepper_z] driver_SGTHRS: 70 Final thoughts # Check out the Klipper sensorless homing documentation for additional details and troubleshooting steps if you&rsquo;re running in to problems.
I mentioned this above but you will potentially need to recalibrate your driver_SGTHRS values if you change motor currents, change, homing speed, or make other big changes to the motion systems. If that happens, just come back to this guide and rerun the steps. The good news is that by setting a value that&rsquo;s in the middle of min and max, you can hopefully make most changes without breaking homing.
With all of this set, you&rsquo;re now ready to actually complete a homing! But you don&rsquo;t want to just hit the homing button in Fluidd. Now that you have stallguard configured, we need to talk about the custom homing macro required for sensorless homing. This guide is already long enough so I&rsquo;m going to cover it in the next one. See you there!
💾 Take a moment now to download a copy of your \`printer.cfg\` to your computer and rename it to include today's date, or \`printer.cfg-endstops_work\` or something like that. If you end up breaking your cfg in future steps, or if your SD card gets corrupted, or anything else like that... you'll be glad you have this saved! I highly recommend repeating this process any time you make important cfg changes. `}),e.add({id:39,href:"/T100-wiki/the100v11/configure/how_to_home/",title:"How to home",description:"How to setup the sensorless homing macro, and then home for the first time!",content:`There&rsquo;s no place like home # The guide for homing your printer could have been much shorter, but I&rsquo;m hoping people use these guides to learn just as much as they do to accomplish something. I also could have made the guides 100x longer and gone in to much more detail, but I want people to actually read them instead of saying &ldquo;this is way too much!&rdquo;
We&rsquo;re finally close&hellip; let&rsquo;s slide in to home.
Requirements # You have completed the sensorless homing prep guide and your printer.cfg matches how we ended the bed movement guide. Know how to do an emergency stop in fluidd/mainsail so you can immediately stop the homing process if your stepper driver if needed. This will help prevent damage to the printer and motion systems. 🛑	Skipping steps and not slowly iterating will result in you getting increasingly frustrated. It's important to make one change at a time, test one thing at a time, and document your progress as you go. If you've made it this far then you're doing great! But for those that have never setup a printer like this before, this is where a lot of frustration will come if you aren't patient and methodical about your setup. 🛑	CORRECTION: Prior to 2023-10-03 I had "max_accel: 300", but it was causing homing issues. Please update your printer.cfg to "max_accel: 1000" to prevent issues with the following steps. Homing macro # The standard homing gcode command is G28. The issue with using the default command is the way THE 100 needs to home is different from the norm. This is because we use sensorless homing on all 3 axis, and because we use part of the homing process to ensure the dual Z motors are equal so that the bed is level.
To override the default G28 behavior, we have to add a few custom macros to our printer.cfg. I&rsquo;m going to just include the macros and steps to install first, and later I&rsquo;ll explain how they work.
Add the macro # Open your printer.cfg and scroll to the bottom. Paste the following below the last line
##### HOMING MACROS START ##### [gcode_macro G28] rename_existing: G280 gcode: M80 SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION Z=0 G90 G1 Z5 F200 SENSORLESS_HOME_X SENSORLESS_HOME_Y SENSORLESS_HOME_Z [gcode_macro SENSORLESS_HOME_X] gcode: SENSORLESS_DELAY # Home G280 X # Move away G1 X{ printer.toolhead.axis_maximum.x/2 } F6000 [gcode_macro SENSORLESS_HOME_Y] gcode: SENSORLESS_DELAY # Home G280 Y # Move away G90 G1 Y{ printer.toolhead.axis_maximum.y/2 } F6000 [gcode_macro SENSORLESS_HOME_Z] gcode: SENSORLESS_DELAY # Home G1 X{ printer.toolhead.axis_maximum.x/2 } Y{ printer.toolhead.axis_maximum.y } F6000 G280 Z SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION Z=1 G1 Z0 F120 G1 Z5 F120 SENSORLESS_DELAY G280 Z G1 Z5 F120 # Make sure we clear the toolhead G1 X{ printer.toolhead.axis_minimum.x +5 } Y{ printer.toolhead.axis_maximum.y -2 } F6000 [gcode_macro SENSORLESS_DELAY] gcode: # Pause to ensure driver stall flag is clear G4 P2000 [gcode_macro M80] gcode: SET_STEPPER_ENABLE STEPPER=stepper_x ENABLE=1 SET_STEPPER_ENABLE STEPPER=stepper_y ENABLE=1 SET_STEPPER_ENABLE STEPPER=stepper_z ENABLE=1 ##### HOMING MACROS END ##### Then click Save &amp; Restart.
Your first home # The time as finally come to home for the first time! I would highly suggest two things before continuing:
Restart Klipper to have a clean slate: 3 dots in the top right &gt; Service &gt; Klipper &gt; Restart icon Manually move your printhead to roughly the middle of the gantry and slightly lower the bed just to give things the best chance of working right Press the 🏠 All button in fluidd, or send G28 via the console. Be prepared to hit Emergency Stop if needed!
If all goes well then your printer should follow these steps:
Bed moves down slightly Toolhead moves to the right until it contacts the frame. It then moves to the center of the bed. Toolhead moves to the back until it contacts the frame. It then moves to the center of the bed. Toolhead moves to the back of the frame again &ndash; this is done to avoid the bed colliding with it Note: If you&rsquo;re using a modified bed that isn&rsquo;t the original, you may have issues with the bed colliding due to the size. The proper fix for that is to use an actual endstop on the Z-axis. Bed moves down slightly, then up until it contacts the frame Bed moves down slightly again, then up until it contacts the frame again Bed moves down, then toolhead moves to the back left Your printer is now homed!!
Troubleshooting # If your toolhead homes to the left instead of right, or front instead of back If you completed all the steps required to ensure your motors move in the proper direction then this probably isn&rsquo;t an issue. The direction it homes is controlled by the position_endstop settings in your printer.cfg and they ultimately don&rsquo;t actually matter. If you followed my guide then they SHOULD be going to the right and to the back, but as long as position 0,0 is in the front left corner of the bed then it doesn&rsquo;t actually matter. If you encounter some other issue, please post about it in Discord 💾 Take a moment now to download a copy of your \`printer.cfg\` to your computer and rename it to include today's date, or \`printer.cfg-homing_works\` or something like that. If you end up breaking your cfg in future steps, or if your SD card gets corrupted, or anything else like that... you'll be glad you have this saved! I highly recommend repeating this process any time you make important cfg changes. Now that your printer is homing correctly, let&rsquo;s get the other components working. Or continue reading if you&rsquo;re interested in what the macro does.

Thermistor sensor type # The sensor_type value is based on the thermistor that comes with CHC Pro. If you&rsquo;re using a different hot end then you may need to change it to a different value. EPCOS 100K B57560G104F is another common option, but check your hot end documentation.
If things are working then you should see your extruder, along with a valid temp, displayed in fluidd.
Gear ratio # If you aren&rsquo;t using a BMG (or clone) then you may not need the gear_ratio setting. Read more about it in the Klipper config
Testing # I recommend removing the bowden tube from the top of your extruder before continuing. This makes it very easy to test without worrying about the hot end.
Manually feed some filament through the extruder until it&rsquo;s coming out of the top.
Extrude # Run the following commands in the fluidd console
M83 G1 E20 F300 Expected: Filament &ldquo;extrudes&rdquo; out of the top, coming off your spool.
Fixes # If the filament actually retracts back towards the spool In your printer.cfg under the [extruder] section, change dir_pin: gpio13 to dir_pin: !gpio13. Click Save &amp; Restart and then repeat the test. If nothing happens Check your motor wiring and that you have it plugged in to the correct port Retract # Run the following commands in the fluidd console
M83 G1 E-20 F300 Expected: Filament &ldquo;retracts&rdquo; back towards the spool. If they did work as expected, I recommend changing min_extrude_temp: 0 from 0 to whatever the lowest temp is that you think you&rsquo;ll ever extrude at. 190 is typically a safe number. This will prevent your extruder from working until the hot end has reached that temp.
Fixes # If things worked when you extruded then no fix should be required here.

Run SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=hotend_fan_test_only SPEED=0 to stop the fan.
Fixes # If the fan doesn&rsquo;t turn on, check your writing and the connection to the SKR Pico If the wiring looks right, it&rsquo;s possible your fan is being prevented from moving due to how it&rsquo;s installed in the hot end fan shroud. I would suggest disassembling it and pulling the fan out and seeing if it works then. If it works: carefully reinstall, ensuring that nothing is getting in the way of the blades spinning. I actually had to do some light sanding on the sides of my shroud to prevent it from squeezing the fan which was causing the outside of the fan to push in to fan blades. Update hot end config # The printer.cfg above has a section that allows you to easily test the hot end fan manually. Now that it&rsquo;s tested and working we need to update that part of the config so that it works along with the hot end thermistor as expected.
Delete the following 2 lines:
[fan_generic hotend_fan_test_only] pin: gpio18 And replace them with:
[heater_fan hotend_fan] pin: gpio18 heater: extruder heater_temp: 40.0 Then do Save &amp; Restart before continuing. Note that the SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=hotend_fan_test_only... command will no longer work after this change, but making this change is necessary for the fan to work as expected.
Heaters # Your printer has a heater for the hot end and a heater for the bed. These next steps will walk you through setting up the heaters and their thermistors.
As before, it&rsquo;s assumed you have done the wiring; that won&rsquo;t be covered in this tutorial.
Hot end # If you have been following along then you already have everything in your printer.cfg to test out the the heater on your hot end!
Run SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=extruder TARGET=41 which will tell it to heat to 41. You should immediately hear the hot end fan come on, and you should see the temperature on the graph go up. If your hot end fan doesn&rsquo;t turn on immediately, make sure you updated the [heater_fan hotend_fan] section above.
After verifying the temp went up as expected, run SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=extruder TARGET=0 to turn the heater back off. The configuration tells the fan to turn off once the heater temp is below 40, so the fan should turn off after a few seconds. The hot end will continue to cool off until it returns to room temp.
In the tuning phase tutorials we&rsquo;ll pid tune it and everything.
Bed # For the bed you need to add the following to your printer.cfg. To keep things organized, I suggest doing it directly after the [heater_fan hotend_fan] section.
[heater_bed] heater_pin: gpio21 sensor_type: EPCOS 100K B57560G104F sensor_pin: gpio26 control: pid pid_Kp: 54.027 pid_Ki: 0.770 pid_Kd: 948.182 min_temp: 0 max_temp: 130 [bed_screws] screw1: 33, 25 screw2: 128, 25 screw3: 33, 135 screw4: 128, 135 Then save and restart.
Thermistor sensor type # The sensor_type value is based on the thermistor that comes with Ender 2 Pro bed. If you&rsquo;re using a different bed then you may need to change it to a different value. ATC Semitec 104NT-4-R025H42G is another common option, but check your heated bed documentation.
If things are working then you should now see your heated bed, along with a valid temp, displayed in fluidd.
Testing # We can now test the bed by running SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=41. The bed doesn&rsquo;t heat up nearly as fast as the hot end, and no fans will come on, but you should see the temp begin to rise on the graph.
Once it becomes obvious that it&rsquo;s working as expected, run SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=0 to turn it back off.
Additional sensors # It&rsquo;s always fun to see more temperatures. Add the following to your printer.cfg to display temperatures for your SKR Pico and BananaPi. I suggest doing it just below the [bed_screws] section.
[temperature_sensor skr_pico] sensor_type: temperature_mcu min_temp: 0 max_temp: 100 [temperature_sensor banana_pi] sensor_type: temperature_host min_temp: 10 max_temp: 100 After a save and restart, you should now see them displayed in fluidd.

In fact, I&rsquo;ll be linking to a number of them through the tuning guide with the expectation that you&rsquo;ll use their guides.
To start off with, Matt (the creator of THE 100), has a great video on how he tunes 3d printers. Matt starts his video by mentioning Ellis&rsquo; Print Tuning Guide which is the most detailed guide I&rsquo;ve ever used. I highly recommend watching Matt&rsquo;s whole video and going through the entire Ellis guide.
However&hellip; I know to get to this point you have spent weeks (or months) buying the parts, printing the pieces, assembling it all, and configuring everything. It has been a long journey and you just want to see something print already! For that reason, I&rsquo;m going to focus on what I consider to be a baseline tune to where you can get something printed.
The end result of this guide will be a printed calibration cube. This will not be the best calibration cube in existence and there will be plenty of fine tuning needed after it&rsquo;s printed, but it&rsquo;s still so exciting and motivating to finally print something!
Now is the time.
Requirements # This guide is written with the assumption that you: have followed my previous guides (the klipper/printer.cfg configuration in particular) aren&rsquo;t using any of THE 100 mods have everything built and ready to go have successfully homed the printer Z endstop # The first item that requires calibrated is the Z offset. We need to know the exact distance between the nozzle and the bed when the Z endstop is triggered during the homing process. That way Klipper understands where Z=0 at. To do that we have to tell Klipper where the z endstop location is.
You can watch this process starting at 2:18 in Matt&rsquo;s video.
Tighten your bed screws down and then loosen them all several turns. This gives us flexibility for bed leveling in the next step. Home the printer Send the printer to location 80,80 G90 G1 X80 Y80 F5000 It should be basically over the center of the bed Send Z_ENDSTOP_CALIBRATE via the console Put a piece of paper under the nozzle and then use the screen displayed in fluidd to lower the print head until it holds the paper pretty tight - lowers the print head and + raises it It typically starts fairly high so you will likely start by hitting -1 a couple times to get the nozzle closer to the paper, then start using -0.1 until you get closer, then -0.05. Use + if you go too far and need to raise it Once the paper is held pretty tight, hit Accept Send SAVE CONFIG via the console. It will update your printer.cfg automatically for you (check the bottom of the file for the changes it made) and it will reboot for you. ℹ️ Because this process is calculating the distance between the nozzle and the bed, you will need to repeat these steps any time you make changes to the nozzle, the bed, the gantry, etc. Anything that would impact that distance even in a little bit. Bed level # Now that your Z offset is correct, we need to level the bed.
You can watch this process starting at 3:20 in Matt&rsquo;s video with one exception: I don&rsquo;t pre-tighten the screws after doing the Z endstop calibration like he did. Either way works though.
Home the printer Send BED_SCREWS_ADJUST via the console This will send the nozzle to above the front left screw and move it to Z=0. It then displays a window for you to interact with in fluidd. Starting with the front left screw, use the paper test to determine if you should tighten or loosen the screw. As you go through each screw you will either hit Adjusted if you had to make significant changes to the screw, or Accept if you didn&rsquo;t. If you do Adjusted then it will come back to that screw after it goes through the other 3. I highly recommend you select Adjusted for all 4 screws on your first pass. It&rsquo;s very likely you will need to do 2, 3, 4, or more passes on your first setup before you get it level. Once you&rsquo;re no longer having to change much on the screw, start hitting Accept. You will very likely have to Will need to loosen other screws at first to get the bed to raise After leveling the bed, it&rsquo;s recommended to repeat the Z endstop calibration again as the position of your bed has almost definitely changed.
PID tuning # PID tuning is an automated process for Klipper to learn how quickly your hotend and bed heat up. This is important so that it can minimize the under and overshooting it goes through when trying to get to the set temperature. Luckily this process is complete automated.
You can read more about this process in the Klipper docs.
You can watch this process starting at 4:30 in Matt&rsquo;s video
Bed # Run PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=60 from the fluidd console and wait for it to complete. Then run SAVE_CONFIG.
Hot end # Run PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder TARGET=200 from the fluidd console and wait for it to complete. Then run SAVE_CONFIG.
After completing both and saving them, you will see new values at the bottom of your printer.cfg that have been automatically added.
If you swap out any components related to your heated bed or hotend &ndash; anything that changes how they heat up or cool down &ndash; you&rsquo;ll want to redo PID tuning. But standard changes don&rsquo;t require it.
E-Steps # Calibrating e-steps is the process of confirming that your extruder motor moves the same amount of filament that it&rsquo;s told to. Meaning if it should deliver 100mm, it actually does.
I have used various methods of doing this, but Matt&rsquo;s process starting at 7:45 in his video is so simple. I highly recommend it. I describe the steps in a bit more detail than Matt does, but I recommend watching how he does it so the taping and measuring makes sense.
Manually feed filament through your extruder and bowden tube until it reaches the hotend and can&rsquo;t go further (your hotend should not be heated up for this). Run the following commands to ensure the extruder motor is engaged G91 G1 E-1 F60 Put a piece of tape directly below the extruder where the filament comes out. This will be used as the starting point for our measurement later. Run G1 E-100 F60 to retract 100mm of filament Once it has completed retracting, put another piece of tape on the filament at the bottom of the extruder Manually remove the filament from your extruder so you can lay it flat Measure the distance between the right side of each piece of tape to confirm it retracted 100mm as expected. If it&rsquo;s 100mm, you&rsquo;re all set! If it&rsquo;s off then you need to calculate a new rotation_distance Calculate rotation distance # Only do this if you didn&rsquo;t get 100mm as expected.
Find the [extruder] section in your printer.cfg. Note your current rotation_distance. Calculate your new rotation_distance using this formula: &lt;new_rotation_distance&gt; = &lt;previous_rotation_distance&gt; * ( &lt;actual_extrude_distance&gt; / 100 ) Note: actual_extrude_distance in this formula is the amount you measured that your extruder actually retracted in the previous step. Update rotation_distance under the [extruder] section. Save &amp; Restart. Repeat the process above to confirm you get 100mm. Add printing macros # Add the following macros to your printer.cfg. These tell the printer what to do to start, end, or cancel a print. For organization purposes I recommend putting them below the [gcode_macro M80] macro.
Note that your cfg will now have a line at the bottom that reads #*# DO NOT EDIT THIS BLOCK OR BELOW. The contents are auto-generated.. The items below that line were added automatically from the steps above. Hopefully it&rsquo;s obvious but I&rsquo;ll say it anyways: don&rsquo;t add anything below that.

About 20 minutes later&hellip; done!!
💾 Take a moment now to download a copy of your \`printer.cfg\` to your computer and rename it to include today's date, or \`printer.cfg-holy_crap_it_printed\` or something like that. If you end up breaking your cfg in future steps, or if your SD card gets corrupted, or anything else like that... you'll be glad you have this saved! I highly recommend repeating this process any time you make important cfg changes. Your first question may be: why did it take 20 minutes? Cura said 12 minutes. And I thought this thing could print a benchy in just a few minutes. Well the answer is: things were intentionally slow to prevent you from destroying your printer on the first print.
Now that things are working, it&rsquo;s time to tune beyond the baseline. I recommend going through all of Ellis&rsquo; Print Tuning Guide. As you get things dialed in and you&rsquo;re ready to go faster, you&rsquo;ll need to make adjustments to your printer.cfg to allow it to move faster. In particular, these items at the top prevent it from going fast
